### Binocular observing programs for Stellarium

This script labels on Stellarium all the [Messier objects](https://www.astroleague.org/programs/BinoDS_Intro) 
and the [double stars](https://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/binomess/binomess.html) suitable for binocular observation
as indicated in the programs envisaged by Astronomical League. 

The script hangs until the user toggles the mounting option.

To install, simply copy the two files (ALdata.inc and ALprograms.ssc) in the default folder where all the current scripts
are saved. The actual path may vary according to the operative system. For instance, on an Ubuntu Linux distribution it is
/usr/share/stellarium/scripts.

Please feel free to report any issue. Suggestions are welcome.

Clear skies.
